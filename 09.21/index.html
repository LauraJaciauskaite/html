  	<h1 id="rec">Quick hummus recipe</h1>

  	  <p>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>
  	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
  	<ul>
 		<li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
  		<li>175g of tahini</li>
  		<li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
  		<li>Half a red pepper</li>
  		<li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
  		<li>1 clove of garlic</li>
  		<li>A dash of olive oil</li> 
  	</ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
  		<li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
  		<li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
  		<li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
  		<li>Process all the ingredients into a paste
          <ul>
    		<li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</li>
    		<li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</li>
         </ul>
     </li>
  </ol>

  	  <p>For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</p>

  	<h3>Storage</h3>

  	  <p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.

  Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</p>
